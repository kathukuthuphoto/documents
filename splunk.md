is it possible to develop a PLM system on splunk platform 
While Splunk is a powerful platform for analyzing and visualizing data, it is not specifically designed as a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system. PLM systems typically have specific features and capabilities, such as bill of materials management, change management, product data management, and workflow automation, which may not be available or may require significant customization to implement in Splunk.

However, it is possible to use Splunk in conjunction with a PLM system to gain additional insights and visibility into product data and processes. For example, you could use Splunk to analyze PLM data, visualize product development workflows, and monitor product quality and performance. You could also integrate Splunk with other systems in your organization, such as ERP systems or supply chain management systems, to gain a more comprehensive view of your product lifecycle.

In summary, while Splunk may not be suitable as a standalone PLM system, it can be a valuable tool for analyzing and visualizing data related to product development and lifecycle management.
